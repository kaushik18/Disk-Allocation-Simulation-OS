Project 3
Class: CS4348.001


For this project I used C++ and had 4 source files and 3 header files. However as for compilation and executable purposes, to make it easier for the TA, I created a makefile.


First, please download all the source files, header files, and the makefile into the same directory/path. 

Compilation Step(s):

1) On Command Line, go to the directory where all the files are located.
2) Type "make". This will produce the object files and the executable called "project3".


Running the Executable:

1) To run the executable project3, type "./project3 [contiguous|indexed|chained]".

2) Note that above, there must be two arguments present for the executable to run and display the options. The first argument is "./project3". The second argument is the allocation method.
